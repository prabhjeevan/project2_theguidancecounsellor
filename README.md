# __THE GUIDANCE COUNSELLOR__

Welcome to the future of guidance counselling.

Covid has changed the ways a lot of things happen these days. It has become quite impossible to get an appointmnet with your schools guidance counsellor and many high school students are left hanging with their questions about their future school for undergrad. This is where this app _THE GUIDANCE COUNSELLOR_ comes in. Here the alumnis or current students will be able to post reviews about their schools, profs, and programs so the future students can come here and have a better understanding of what they are getting into.

__NEXT STEPS :__

* Add features so only users have limited options such as add and remove only their own stuff. Instead of being able to remove everything.

* In terms of coding and becoming a real developer I could definitely improve on making more commits and following a good routine when coming up with something new. I learnt my lesson the hard way when I spent 2 days just working on the styling aspect of the game and then realizing I would need much more time on actually getting the functionatily to work. So note to self for the future is to get the app working first and then styling can happen at last.
