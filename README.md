__NEXT STEPS :__

* Add features so only users have limited options such as add and remove only their own stuff. Instead of being able to remove everything.

* In terms of coding and becoming a real developer I could definitely improve on making more commits and following a good routine when coming up with something new. I learnt my lesson the hard way when I spent 2 days just working on the styling aspect of the game and then realizing I would need much more time on actually getting the functionatily to work. So note to self for the future is to get the app working first and then styling can happen at last.
